It's gamee timee!!

The goal of the player is to reach 100. The one who reaches 100 1st will be the winner.
The player is allowed to roll the die and the score will be added to the current score. The player can hold the current score and add it to the total 
score or roll the dice again which also adds to the current score unless the dice hits 1. If the dice hits 1 the current score resets to 0 and the player
turn will be changed.
